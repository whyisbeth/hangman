Using JS and HTML, create a version of the game Hangman (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).
The game can generally be implemented however you want but should adhere to the following:

1) Start game by entering a word into a text box.
2) Display an underscore for each letter of the word.
3) Enter a letter guess into another text box and submit by clicking a button.
4) Whenever a correct guess is made, reveal the letter in the word by replacing the corresponding underscore.
5) Whenever a wrong guess is made, draw another piece of the hangman.  To save time, you can just decrement a "Remaining Guesses" counter instead of actually drawing a hangman.
6) If you guess the word display a "You win!" alert, otherwise display a "You lose!" alert.

This should represent production-ready code, so show us code you would be proud to deploy.
